Twitter Bootstrap

Essentially, you figure out what you want to download and the compiler does a bunch of stuff for you and gives you
three folders: /css/, /img/, and /js/.  I'm guessing /img/ is the sprits, /js/ is the jQuery add-ons (I think you need to reference jQuery separately),
and CSS is the compiled CSS (I say compiled because it's coming from something called LESS files, which I'm not sure about).
